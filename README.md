Java Assesment

# What do you like about this projct?

Its MUCH MUCH!!! more challenging then expected but i had fun doing it!


# What did you struggle with in this project?

I think the whole assessment in general was very much a struggle, but lucky we were given more time to work on the assesment if not i dont think i could complete
most part. 


# What would make your experience with this assessment better?

Really hope that there were more lesson on java because alot of concept but too little time.. But overall i really love this assesment because its a very good 
study material. And i must say given the time jean had on hand to teach us java its amazing how much she had taught us.
